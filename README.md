# CS2106 Assignments

This is a repository of lab for CS2106, Introduction to Operating Systems, which is taught in NUS.

This repository is divided into different files for each of the 4 labs, and each lab has its code divided into its
composite parts, and a `demo_scripts` file with scripts which compile and run the desired test code.

To make a script a runnable, create a file with a `.sh` extension, and use `chmod +x <FILENAME>.sh`
to make it an executable.

Next, enter <FILENAME>.sh into the command line to run the script.

```shell
chmod +x <FILENAME>.sh
<FILENAME>.sh
```
Lab answers are included in the `.docx` file in each lab's folder.
